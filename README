1. Purpose
----------

XkbSwitch is a simple piece of software to overcome the annoying
limitation of Xkb, which allows only four keyboard groups to be
used at a time. It is possible to get over the limitation by using
self-made composite keyboard layouts or special input methods, but
standard national layouts are better. XkbSwitch consists of the
daemon, which listens on D-Bus and performs layout reloads (if
necessary) and group locks. It tries to minimize the reloads by
tracking layouts usage. Layout switch requests are performed through
the trivial D-Bus interface (only one method), exported by the
daemon, by very simple client program. The client program is
implemented in C to minimize start-up time and uses only low-level
D-Bus facilities.

2. Installation
---------------

Dependencies are:
 * Python >=2.5;
 * dbus >=1.2;
 * dbus-python >=0.83;
 * libxklavier >=3.9.

Build dependencies are:
 * C compiler;
 * GNU make.

To build everything use:

$ make

Installation is manual for now. xkbswitch and xkbswitch-daemon files
should be copied to somewhere in your $PATH. For example:

# cp xkbswitch xkbswitch-daemon /usr/local/bin
$ cp xkbswitch xkbswitch-daemon ~/bin

Extension file xkbswitch.so should be copied where the python modules
resides on your system. Usually it is something like
/usr/local/lib/python2.5/site-packages/ or
/usr/lib/python2.6/site-packages/.

3. Usage
--------

XkbSwitch daemon has to be started on running X session:

$ xkbswitch-daemon &

After this the xkbswitch client program should be used to switch
keyboard layouts:

$ xkbswitch 'gr(bare)'
$ xkbswitch epo
$ xkbswitch 'ru(typewriter)'
$ xkbswitch es
$ xkbswitch no_such_layout
Layout switch failed
$ xkbswitch ru
$ xkbswitch us

It is really convenient to define some hot-keys. For example:

<Alt+Shift+e>   execute "xkbswitch epo"
<Alt+Shift+g>   execute "xkbswitch 'gr(bare)'"
<Alt+Shift+i>   execute "xkbswitch is"
<Alt+Shift+r>   execute "xkbswitch 'ru(typewriter)'"
<Alt+Shift+s>   execute "xkbswitch sr"

4. Bugs & problems
------------------

* X display name couldn't be specified for xkbswitch-daemon;
* daemon wouldn't die on exit from X session;
* documentation sucks (but bad sex is better than nothing);
* manual installation really sucks (use distutils?);
* nobody cares about this software 'cause nobody really needs more
  than four Xkb groups.

5. TODOs
-------

* D-Bus signals from daemon on layout change;
* dump extension module and use ctypes;
* kill bugs.
